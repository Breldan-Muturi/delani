DESCRIPTION
The online web app is basically a web page designed using html, css and JavaScript. It's been designed for people interested in Studio services such as designing promotional content. Delani offers to do both partial and wholesome jobs for their clients. Basically after naigating the site and understanding how Delani operates as a studio, the user ha the option to leave their contact details ,specifically the email for Delani studio to reach out to them. Once the email has been submitted, the user is added as a subscriber to Delani studio over mailChimp which then allows them to receive automated updates from Delani studio. The user can also mesage Delani studio directly over the messages area so that Delani studio can respond to their queries directly from the site.

To install the project it is necessary to follow these steps:
* Open https://github.com/Turi-byte/delani. On the top right corner of your screen, you should see a button with the text 'Fork'. 
* Clicking on this button should start the process of copying the project/repository to your own account.Click on that button which should result in a modal prompting you to choose the account to which you want to fork.
* Select your account name which should take you to the repo you forked in your account. For example, if your GitHub username is 'Turi-byte', you should select it and not anything else that appears in the modal. This may take a couple of seconds so be patient as the process takes place.
* To know that the forking process is complete, check the top left corner of your repo. You should be in your account in a repo with the same name as the original repository (your_username/Ghananian-calender). This shows that the forking process is complete.
* Having copied the repo to your own account, you can then proceed to clone it.Run the git clone command to clone the repo to your preferred location.
* Navigate to inside the cloned repository by using the change directory (cd) command.
* Open your editor by using the command atom . for Atom users or code . for Visual Studio Code users.
* You are now ready to inspect and make modifications to the project.
